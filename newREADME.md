# COVID-Project-
Covid 19 Data Exploration in SQL Portfolio Project

In this project, I will use two datasets containing global data on Covid 19 from 1/1/20, specifically related to deaths and vacctionation rates.

I used MySQL Server to explore the data. Some of the skills used during the project include Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. 

These have then been imput into Tableu to create a dashboard.
